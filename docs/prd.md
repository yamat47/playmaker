PRD: Web-Based 11-Player Football Play Diagramming Tool
=============

Overview
----------------------

This browser-based application enables American-football coaches to design complex 11-player offensive and defensive play diagrams on an interactive digital whiteboard. It emphasizes portability through PNG export, delivers a feature-rich yet user-friendly interface, and avoids platform lock-in.

Target Users
----------

	•	Primary: High-school and college coaches (head, coordinators, position coaches, analysts) responsible for play design.
	•	Use cases: Creating offensive plays, defensive schemes, scout-team cards, weekly game plans, and instructional materials.
	•	Secondary: Football educators or illustrators producing diagrams for clinics, textbooks, or media.

Core Features
--------------

### Interactive Field Diagram & Player Setup

	•	Realistic football-field canvas (grid or turf with yard lines).
	•	Drag-and-drop placement of up to 22 player icons, each labeled (e.g., QB, MLB).
	•	Distinct visual styles for offense and defense, with formation-shift grouping.

### Player Position Labeling & Customization

	•	Editable text labels and icon shapes (circle/triangle, X/O) with color and size options.
	•	Library of common position abbreviations.

### Offensive & Defensive Mode Toggle

	•	Context-sensitive toolsets for offense (routes, blocking) and defense (coverages, blitzes).
	•	Visual focus indicator highlights the side currently being edited.

### Run/Pass Play Selection (Offense)

	•	Run mode: emphasizes ball-carrier path and blocking lines.
	•	Pass mode: emphasizes receiver routes, QB dropback, and defensive coverages.

### Drawing Tools for Assignments

	•	Route Arrows: straight or curved, with templates (go, post, out, drag, etc.).
	•	Blocking Lines: specialized endpoint markers indicating blocks.
	•	Motion & Handoff Indicators: dashed lines or color variants.
	•	Coverage & Blitz Tools: translucent zone shapes, man-coverage trails, blitz arrows.
	•	Line Customization: selectable endpoints, styles, thickness, and colors.
	•	Automatic Drawing Aids (future): quick-add stencils for common patterns.

### Editing & Interaction Controls

	•	Undo/redo history.
	•	Drag handles on all elements for refinement.
	•	Smooth zoom / pan; optional snap-to-grid and alignment guides.
	•	Layer visibility toggles (e.g., hide defense).
	•	Contextual menus (e.g., flip play, copy/paste routes).
	•	Direct manipulation principle: minimal data entry.

### Export to PNG

	•	One-click export of the diagram exactly as displayed, without metadata overlays.
	•	Clean PNG ensures easy sharing, printing, and ownership.

Non-Functional Requirements
----------------------

Category	Requirements
Platform & Browser	Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge); no plugins; ≥ 13″ screens; mouse/trackpad input.
Performance	Instantaneous dragging and drawing; handles 22 players and numerous lines without lag (HTML5 Canvas/SVG optimizations).
Usability	Intuitive icons/tooltips; sketch a basic play within minutes; optional help overlay.
Visual Clarity	High-resolution vector or canvas rendering; color-blind-friendly palette; consistent offensive/defensive colors.
Reliability	Stable under extended use; graceful error handling; optional local auto-save.
Security	Served over HTTPS; minimal sensitive data; vetted third-party libraries.
Scalability	Modular architecture for future features (e.g., 7-on-7, Canadian football).
Accessibility	Keyboard shortcuts; high-contrast mode; scalable text; partial ARIA compliance.

Out of Scope
-------------

	•	Mobile/touch optimization for phones.
	•	Real-time animation or simulation of plays.
	•	Video integration or film analysis.
	•	Cloud-based playbook database, team management, or multi-user collaboration.
	•	Special-teams-specific tools and non-11-player scenarios.
	•	Advanced diagramming (formation templates, batch printing, AI suggestions).
	•	Export formats beyond PNG.
	•	Rich text annotation beyond basic labels.

Notes for Implementation
-----------------

	1.	Technology Stack: SPA using HTML5 Canvas and/or SVG with React / TypeScript; drawing handled by libraries such as Fabric.js or Konva.js.
	2.	Diagram Layering: Field base → zone shapes → assignment lines → player icons; selected elements rendered on top.
	3.	State Management: Command pattern or comparable stack for undo/redo; JSON data model for players and lines.
	4.	Drawing Interaction: Click-and-drag for lines; optional single-segment initially, with post-draw curve/angle editing; preset route shapes selectable.
	5.	Mode Toggles: Offense/defense and run/pass implemented as UI flags influencing default colors and available tools, without restricting user actions.
	6.	PNG Export: Canvas toDataURL() or SVG-to-PNG converter, omitting selection handles; default full-field scale.
	7.	User Testing: Early coach feedback sessions to refine nomenclature, icons, and workflow.
	8.	Future Extensibility: JSON play model allows later cloud save, formation templates, or multi-coach collaboration.
	9.	Competitive Focus: Prioritize speed, clarity, and content ownership—key differentiators from Hudl, Football Play Card, and Pro Quick Draw.
